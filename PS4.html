         <img src="PS4Games/PS4Minecraft.png" height="400" width="300" align="left">
        <p1>Minecraft is split into two separate game modes. Creative and Survival. 
You can play both of them in multiplayer. If you’re mostly interested in making huge 
structures from scratch with unlimited resources, Creative mode is your best bet. You 
won’t see any enemies, and you can pull blocks of all shapes and sizes out of thin air.
However, if you’d prefer to adventure into a world of danger, where you’re crafting and 
creating out of necessity, you’ll probably want to play in Survival mode. That comes with
 gangs of monsters who want to break/explode/eat your bones, one pixel at a time. You’ll 
need to protect yourself from the creatures that come out at night.</p1>
